Pok ́emon: Gotta Find Them All!

This is a minesweeper-like game, and it has the same method of testing victory, 
that is, whether the flags are placed on all animal grids.

The file a1_without_bigfunsearch.py doesn't use the function big_fun_search() gave
by designer, this function could explore the neigbhouring cells with no pokemon in
surrounding direction.

The final version a1.py is written in order to satisfy this function.

Afterwards, you can check the completion of the function through test.py in the test folder。
